Associate Professor in the College of Physics and Information Engineering, Fuzhou University.

I received the B.S. degree from the Department of Physics, Tsinghua University, in 2017, and the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, in 2023. During my Ph.D. and subsequent postdoctoral research (until 2025), I worked in the 3D Vision and Computational Photography Lab led by [Yebin Liu](http://www.liuyebin.com/).

My current research interests include 3D vision and AI-based modeling methods, with applications in digital humans and related areas.
